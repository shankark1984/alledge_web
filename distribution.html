                        <p class="mb-4">If a customer receives a damaged, late or incorrect product, they are likely to
                            have a bad experience and will not buy from the company again. Distribution logistics is key
                            to minimizing this type of situation and ensuring that customers are satisfied with their
                            shopping experience.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">The main objective of distribution logistics is to guarantee an efficient and
                            effective flow of products from their point of origin to their final destination. To achieve
                            this, a series of key objectives are established to guide all activities and decisions
                            related to this discipline.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">AllEdge focuses on optimizing product flows, which helps to reduce operating costs
                        and increase the company’s efficiency. By planning proper distribution routes, consolidating
                        loads and efficiently managing inventory, transportation and warehousing costs can be minimized.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">In addition, by efficiently managing lead times, you can improve production
                        processes and ensure greater business efficiency.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">AllEdge is responsible for managing inventory, which means it can help minimize the
                        costs associated with warehousing products. By maintaining proper inventory control, additional
                        costs associated with excessive storage, obsolete products or product losses can be avoided.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">AllEdge can also help ensure proper inventory turnover, which means that products do
                        not sit in storage for too long and lose value.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">AllEdge also helps companies adapt quickly to changes in the market and in customer
                        demand. By efficiently managing product flows, distribution routes and inventories can be
                        quickly adjusted to respond to changes in demand. This allows companies to be more flexible and
                        able to meet the changing needs of their customers.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">In summary, AllEdge is crucial for improving customer satisfaction, increasing
                        operational efficiency, enabling efficient inventory management and improving the adaptability
                        of companies.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">In the following sections, we will explore the main stages of distribution logistics
                        and how each of them contributes to these objectives.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">
                    <h1 class="display-10">Reception and storage of products</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">At this stage, products are received from suppliers or from the company’s internal
                        production. The quality and quantity of the products are verified and recorded in the inventory.
                        The products are then stored in the warehouse or distribution center in an organized and secure
                        manner, ready to be processed and shipped to customers.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">
                    <h1 class="display-10">Order processing</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">At this stage, customer orders are received and processed. This involves verifying
                        product availability in inventory, confirming customer information and preparing the necessary
                        documentation. In addition, the various elements of the order are coordinated, such as product
                        selection, packaging and assignment of the appropriate transport.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">

                    <h1 class="display-10">Preparation of goods for shipment</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">Once the orders have been processed, the goods are prepared for shipment. This
                        includes activities such as packaging the products, proper labeling, generating the necessary
                        documentation (such as waybills) and preparing the products for loading onto transport vehicles.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Though it is possible to improve production and reduce errors with this type of
                        warehouse, it has certain disadvantages. Redesigning procedures that demand a higher technical
                        ability necessitates retraining the employees and may take many years to pay back the original
                        expenditure.</p>

            </div>

                    <h1 class="display-10">Transportation of productse</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">At this stage, the products are transported from the distribution center to their
                        final destination. The most efficient transportation routes are chosen, considering factors such
                        as distance, time, costs and the nature of the products. During transport, shipments are
                        constantly monitored to ensure that they arrive on time and in the agreed conditions.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The last stage of distribution logistics is the delivery of products to customers.
                        This involves unloading the products from the transport vehicle, checking their condition and
                        delivering them to the customer at the agreed place and time. In some cases, it may be necessary
                        to perform the installation or commissioning of the products, according to the customer’s
                        instructions and requirements.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Each of these stages plays a fundamental role in the distribution logistics process,
                        helping to ensure that products reach customers in a timely manner, meeting their expectations
                        and generating satisfaction.</p>

                    <h1 class="display-10">Comply with delivery deadlines</h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">One of the fundamental objectives of distribution logistics is to ensure that
                        products reach customers at the agreed time. This involves careful planning of transport times,
                        coordination of preparation and dispatch processes, and optimization of distribution routes.
                        Meeting promised delivery deadlines is essential to generate customer confidence and
